# Contributing

So you want to contribute?
Well, thanks!

At the moment, contributing is lawless, so feel free to contribute to *this* document too.

## Things you can contribute

### Configurations

Want to add a new design (or two)?
Simply create a new folder continuing the numbering of the other folders.
Create a schematic (or modify an existing one) in [KiCad](https://kicad-pcb.org/download/) (it's free!).
Provide screenshots of the schematics to show others what it looks like without making them download KiCad.
Make sure to fill in the README in the `design_x/` directory and add to the table in the root README.
If you're stuck on what to add, look at design 1.  
Submit your changes as a pull request.

### Bugs

Please don't add bugs.
But if you want to fix any issues you've found with the designs, that'd be great.
Just submit a pull request with the changes.  
If you don't know how to fix it, feel free to submit a bug report instead.
There are no guidelines for bug reports (yet), so just try to provide as much information as you can.

### Contributing file

This file definitely needs improvement.
If there's anything you want to add, just make a pull request with those changes.
